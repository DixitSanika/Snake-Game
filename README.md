# Snake-Game
The Snake Game code works by creating a game window where a snake moves around, eats food to grow, and avoids hitting the walls or itself. The game keeps track of the score and ends if the snake crashes. Player controls the snake using arrow keys, and the game runs in a loop until it's over.

In the Snake Game code, we have used the following:  
1. **Python & Pygame:**  
   - Pygame library to create and manage the game.  

2. **Game Window:**  
   - To display the game screen.  

3. **Snake & Food:**  
   - The snake is made of small blocks, and food appears randomly.  

4. **Keyboard Controls:**  
   - Arrow keys to move the snake.  

5. **Collision Detection:**  
   - To check if the snake hits the wall or itself.  

6. **Score System:**  
   - To count how much food the snake eats.  

7. **Game Loop:**  
   - Runs the game continuously until you lose.
